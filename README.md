# HW4-Code-Quiz
This homework is to create a page that gives a 5 question coding quiz that needs to be completed in a certain amount of time.

The starting page has a brief description with a start button and a view highscore button
The quiz starts when the start button is pressed.
The quiz ends when the timer runs out or all the questions were answered
Missing a question subtracts 10 from the timer
The final score is determined by the time remainding.
The user has the option to submit thier score to the leaderboard
The leaderboard is stored in localStorage so the user can come back and see the scores.
